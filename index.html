      <p>
        So, what is an industrial robot? An industrial robot is one that has
        been developed to automate intensive production tasks such as those
        required by a constantly moving assembly line. As large, heavy robots,
        they are placed in fixed positions within an industrial plant and all
        other worker tasks and processes revolve around them. The
        characteristics of industrial robots will vary according to the
        manufacturers, the needs and the scenario in which they are to be
        located. According to the international standard ISO 8373:2012, the
        industrial robot definition is ‘a multifunctional, reprogrammable,
        automatically controlled manipulator, programmable in three or more axes
        that can be fixed in one area or mobile for use in industrial automation
        applications’. Industrial robots are not usually humanoid in form,
        although they are capable of reproducing human movements and behaviours
        but with the strength, precision and speed of a machine. This following
        table extracted from the World Robotics 2021 report shows the evolution
        and forecast of mobile robot installations per year.

      <h3>Japan is World´s number one Robot Maker</h3>
<p>
  Frankfurt, Tokyo, Mar 10, 2022 — Japan is the world´s number one industrial robot manufacturer – delivering 45% of the global supply.
   In recent years, the country’s robot suppliers have increased their production capacity considerably: Their export ratio rose to 78% in 2020, when 136,069 industrial robots were shipped. 
   These are results published by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) ahead of the International Robot Exhibition (iREX) in Tokyo, March 09 to 12, 2022.

        <h3>Korea confidently improves the robot industry</h3>
        <p>The World Robotics report shows a new record stock of about 300,000 operational industrial robots in the Republic of Korea in 2018 (+10%). 
          Within five years, the country has doubled its number of industrial robots. Following Japan and China, the country ranked third in 2018.
           But the dynamics of robot installations has decreased in recent years and for 2019 a continued decrease is expected.</p>
